        <h2>Music</h2><p>A little fun fact about myself is I LOVE old music. I love evrything about them, the message the instruments(especially the solos). I've recently started to go deeper into older music. I used to listen to 60's like the Beatles,Queen, and various other bands. Currently I've been listening to the Ink Spots a lot. This band was created in the mid 30's. the calmness and harmony relaxes me. I feel I am truely an old soul.</p></div>
        <div style="display: inline-block; width: 24.75%;">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2><p>Some hobbies I have is skateboarding, meditating, hanging with friends, and listening to music. I love skateboarding because I love the thought of riding somehwere and not know where I'm going, having no plan, no thought, just riding. I love meditating because I feel at peace and evrything bad that happend to me that day just melts away. It also helps me sleep. I love all my firends, my friend group is not too big but not too  small but I always welcome new people with open arms. Music has gotten me through a lot of challenges in my life. Music makes me so happy and helps me identify my feeling when they seem to be lost.</p></div>
