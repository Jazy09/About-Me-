        <div style=display:inline-block;width:80%;><p> I LOVE to entertain people! When I make people laugh it makes me feel so good inside. All my friends and family memebrs have told me to start doing youtube because they think I could be famous. Honestly I think if I really tried then I could because every person I meet, I make laugh somehow. Honestly it's not even about becoming famous, for me its about how many people I could make laugh or how I could possibly lift someones spirits after a bad day just from them watching my content.</p></div>
